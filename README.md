# Welcome to my little game testing place
This project is my little playground where I experiment with animation and physics to better understand
how game mechanics come to life. It’s also the place where I share my 2D pixel art, combining my love for both art and design.
Working on this not only helps me learn, but also gives me the joy of creating something I’ve always dreamed about.

# #1: The Orange Cat
This Orange Cat i got from the free assets somewhere in the internet ( i stole not gonna lie), then i t start testing with him to understand how the animations work,
I create a basic movement interaction for him and its look like this:
